Applied Data Science on COVID-19 data

Project Description
-------------------

    The project involves the following goals:
    
    1.  Building a COVID-19 confirmed cases dashboard following CRISP-DM process.
    
    2.  Data Understanding and collection through Web Scraping, REST API calls and also pulling data from GitHub.
    
    3.  Data Processing using libraries like pandas and numpy and checking the data structure on small data.
    
    4.  Building a model on the small data-set, to get the feel of the final product. Creating the dashboard to know how the end product should look like.
    
    5.  Complete processed data-set preparation.
    
    6.  Calculation of Doubling Rate. Calculation of filtered values for Confirmed cases and Doubling Rate.
    
    7.  Forecasting of the cases using Facebook prophet.
    
    8.  Using the processed data to build a SIR model.
    
    9.  Bringing in world population data, country-wise to build SIR data.
    
    10. Building a dashboard which can plot confirmed cases, doubling rate, their filtered values and SIR curves.
